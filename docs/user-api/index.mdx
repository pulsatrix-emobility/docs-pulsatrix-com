# User API

The User API supports three different protocols that can be used to communicate with the pulsatrix charging station controller. We provide a RESTful API, a WebSocket API and a MQTT API. While REST and Websocket offer similar endpoints and data types, MQTT uses a message- and topic-based model with some additional data.

## RESTful API
We provide a high-level [**documentation for the RESTful API**](/docs/ws-rest-api). Additionally, there is an [**OpenAPI/Swagger-based**](/user-api/swagger) documentation available which is suitable for client code generation.

## WebSocket API

The WebSocket API uses the same DTOs as the RESTful API and is [**documented alongside of it**](/docs/ws-rest-api)

## MQTT API

The MQTT API is based on topics and messages. You can find its details [**here**](/docs/mqtt-api)
