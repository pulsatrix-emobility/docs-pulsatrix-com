# User API

The User API has 3 different protocolls that can be used to communicate with the controller. We provide a RESTful API, a WebSocket API and a MQTT API. While REST and Websocket have the same Endpoints, MQTT has a different structure with some additional data.  

## RESTful API
We have 2 documentation for the RESTful API. One is in the [**docs**](/docs/ws-rest-api) and the other one is a [**Swagger**](/user-api/swagger) documentation.
