To set the limits of a charging session, send a message body with only the value to the desired topic.

`/charging/amperageLimit`- *flaot* - Set the maximum amperage the charger will allow the vehicle to draw in amps. 
- The charger always sets the limit to the minimum of all currently valid limits. This could lead to a
situation where the limit set by the API is ignored because it is higher than the limit set byanother part of the system.
- A limit below 6A will be ignored and the charger will set the limit to 0A.
- A limit above the effectiveAmperageLimit will be ignored and the charger will set the limit to the effectiveAmperageLimit.

`/charging/powerLimit` - *int* - Set the maximum power the charger will allow the vehicle to draw in watts.
- The power limit is effectively calculated back to the amperage limit and behaves the same as described above. (powerLimit / voltage = amperageLimit) 

`/charging/limitTimeout` - *int* - Set the time in milliseconds the data set by the API will be valid.
- The defult timeout for values set by the API is 300000 milliseconds (5 minutes).
