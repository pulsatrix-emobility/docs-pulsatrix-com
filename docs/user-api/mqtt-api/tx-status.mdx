  - `SuspendedEV` - The charge point is suspended by the electric vehicle.
  - `Finishing` - The charge point is finishing a transaction.
  - `Reserved` - The charge point is reserved and not available for charging.
  - `Unavailable` - The charge point is not available.
  - `Faulted` - The charge point is in an error state.  

- `effectiveAmperageLimit`- EffectiveAmperageLimit - absolute amperage limit of the charge point --------- FIXME: description

- `startedTime` - Time when the charge point started charging.  

- `endedTime` - Time when the charge point stopped charging.  

- `startReason` - Reason why the charging was started.
  - `Authorized` - Charging is authorized, by any means. Might be an RFID, or other authorization means.
  - `CablePluggedIn` - Cable is plugged in and EVDetected.
