FIXME: description

- `id` - *String* - UUID of the charging session.

- `state` - *String* - State of the charge controller
  - `IDLE` - The charge point is not charging.
  - `AWAITING_START` -  The EV is connected and the charge point is waiting for a start transaction.
  - `AWAITING_AUTHORIZATION` - The EV is connected and the charge point is waiting for an authorization.
  - `STARTING` - The EV is connected and the charge point is starting the charging session.
  - `SUSPENDED_EVSE` - Charging is suspended by the charge point.
  - `SUSPENDED_EV` - The charge point is suspended by the electric vehicle.
  - `CHARGING` - The charge point is charging.
  - `FAILED` - The charge point is in an error state.  
  - `STOPPED` - The EV is connected and charing is stopped.
  - `LINGERING` - The EV is currently connected or was recently connected and the charge point is still in the same transaction.
  - `COMPLETED` - Charing is completed, EV is not connected, charge point is availabile.


- `effectiveAmperageLimit` - *float* - EffectiveAmperageLimit - absolute amperage limit of the charge point --------- FIXME: description

- `startedTime` - *float* - Time when the charge point started charging.  

- `endedTime` - *float* - Time when the charge point stopped charging.  

- `startReason` - *String* - Reason why the charging was started.
  - `Authorized` - Charging is authorized, by any means. Might be an RFID, or other authorization means.
  - `CablePluggedIn` - Cable is plugged in and EVDetected.
  - `ChargingRateChanged` - Rate of charging changed by more than LimitChangeSignificance.
  - `ChargingStateChanged` - Charging State changed.
  - `Deauthorized` - The transaction was stopped because of the authorization status in the response to a transactionEventRequest.
  - `EnergyLimitReached` - Maximum energy of charging reached. For example: in a pre-paid charging solution.
  - `EVCommunicationLost` - Communication with EV lost, for example: cable disconnected.
  - `EVConnectTimeout` - EV not connected before the connection is timed out.
  - `MeterValueClock` - Needed to send a clock aligned meter value.
  - `MeterValuePeriodic` - Needed to send a periodic meter value.
  - `TimeLimitReached` - Maximum time of charging reached. For example: in a pre-paid charging solution.
  - `Trigger` - Requested by the CSMS via a TriggerMessageRequest.
  - `UnlockCommand` - CSMS sent an Unlock Connector command.
  - `StopAuthorized` - An EV Driver has been authorized to stop charging. For example: By swiping an RFID card.
  - `EVDeparted` - EV departed. For example: When a departing EV triggers a parking bay detector.
  - `EVDetected` - EV detected. For example: When an arriving EV triggers a parking bay detector.
  - `RemoteStop` - A RequestStopTransactionRequest has been sent.
  - `RemoteStart` - A RequestStartTransactionRequest has been sent.
  - `AbnormalCondition` - An Abnormal Error or Fault Condition has occurred.
  - `SignedDataReceived` - Signed data is received from the energy meter.
  - `ResetCommand` - CSMS sent a Reset Charging Station command.

- `energyActiveImportRegister` - FIXME: description

- `lastActivePower` - *float* - Current active power of the charge point.

- `meterStart` - *float* - Value of the energyMeter at the start of the session.

- `meterStop` - *float* - Value of the energyMeter at the end of the session.

- `peakPhaseAmperage` - FIXME: datatype - Peak amperage values for each phase of the charge point.

- `peakActivePower` - *float* - Peak active power of the charge point.
