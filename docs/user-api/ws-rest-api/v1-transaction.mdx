The `transaction` endpoint returns transactional information about the charging session. 

## Values

- `state` - *String* - State of the SECC
  - `Idle` - No EV connected.
  - `Charging` - The EVSE is charging.
  - `SuspendedEVSE` - The EVSE is suspended by the
  - `SuspendedEV` - The EVSE is suspended by the electric vehicle.
  - `Finishing` - The EVSE is finishing a transaction.
  - `Reserved` - The EVSE is reserved and not available for charging.
  - `Unavailable` - The EVSE is not available.
  - `Faulted` - The EVSE is in an error state.

- `startedTime` - *int* - Time when the EVSE started charging.

- `endedTime` - *int* - Time when the EVSE stopped charging.

- `meterStart` - *float* - Value of the energyMeter at the start of the session.

- `meterStop` - *float* - Value of the energyMeter at the end of the session.

- `vehicleStatus` - *String* - IEC 61851 Status of the EV
  - `A1` - Standby
  - `B1` - Vehicle detected
  - `C1` - Charge request
  - `D1` - Charge & vent request
  - `E1` - Shut off
  - `F1` - Error
  - `S1` - Restart after error status
  - `R1` - Diode fail
  - `B2` - Charging offered
  - `C2`- Charging
  - `D2` - Charging + venting

- `chargeControllerStatus` - *String* - IEC 61851 Status of the SECC
  - `A` - Disconnected
  - `B` - Connected
  - `C` - Charge request
  - `D` - Charge & ventilation request
  - `E` - Short circuit
  - `F` - Error
  - `S` - Startup / unknown
  - `R` - Diode fail

- `usedPhasesSession` *String* - Phases used for charging the EV.

- `startReason` - *String* - Reason for starting the charging session.
  - `Authorized` - Charging is authorized, by any means. Might be an RFID, or other authorization means.
  - `CablePluggedIn` - Cable is plugged in and EVDetected.
  - `ChargingRateChanged` - Rate of charging changed by more than LimitChangeSignificance.
  - `ChargingStateChanged` - Charging State changed.
  - `Deauthorized` - The transaction was stopped because of the authorization status in the response to a transactionEventRequest.
  - `EnergyLimitReached` - Maximum energy of charging reached. For example: in a pre-paid charging solution.
  - `EVCommunicationLost` - Communication with EV lost, for example: cable disconnected.
  - `EVConnectTimeout` - EV not connected before the connection is timed out.
  - `MeterValueClock` - Needed to send a clock aligned meter value.
  - `MeterValuePeriodic` - Needed to send a periodic meter value.
  - `TimeLimitReached` - Maximum time of charging reached. For example: in a pre-paid charging solution.
  - `Trigger` - Requested by the CSMS via a TriggerMessageRequest.
  - `UnlockCommand` - CSMS sent an Unlock Connector command.
  - `StopAuthorized` - An EV Driver has been authorized to stop charging. For example: By swiping an RFID card.
  - `EVDeparted` - EV departed. For example: When a departing EV triggers a parking bay detector.
  - `EVDetected` - EV detected. For example: When an arriving EV triggers a parking bay detector.
  - `RemoteStop` - A RequestStopTransactionRequest has been sent.
  - `RemoteStart` - A RequestStartTransactionRequest has been sent.
  - `AbnormalCondition` - An Abnormal Error or Fault Condition has occurred.
  - `SignedDataReceived` - Signed data is received from the energy meter.
  - `ResetCommand` - CSMS sent a Reset Charging Station command.

- `stopReason` - *String* - Reason for stopping the charging session.
  - `DeAuthorized` - The transaction was stopped because of the authorization status in the response to a transactionEventRequest.
  - `EmergencyStop` - Emergency stop button was used.
  - `EnergyLimitReached` - EV charging session reached a locally enforced maximum energy transfer limit
  - `EVDisconnected` - Disconnecting of cable, vehicle moved away from inductive charge unit.
  - `GroundFault` - A GroundFault has occurred
  - `ImmediateReset` - A Reset(Immediate) command was received.
  - `Local` - Stopped locally on request of the EV Driver at the EVSE. This is a regular termination of a transaction. Examples: presenting an IdToken tag, pressing a button to stop.
  - `LocalOutOfCredit` - A local credit limit enforced through the EVSE has been exceeded.
  - `MasterPass` - The transaction was stopped using a token with a MasterPassGroupId.
  - `Other` - Any other reason.
  - `OvercurrentFault` - A larger than intended electric current has occurred
  - `PowerLoss` - Complete loss of power.
  - `PowerQuality` - Quality of power too low, e.g. voltage too low/high, phase imbalance, etc.
  - `Reboot` - A locally initiated reset/reboot occurred. (for instance watchdog kicked in)
  - `Remote` - Stopped remotely on request of the CSMS. This is a regular termination of a transaction.
  - `SOCLimitReached` - EV has reported reaching a locally enforced maximum battery State of Charge (SOC)
  - `StoppedByEV` - The transaction was stopped by the EV
  - `TimeLimitReached` - EV charging session reached a locally enforced time limit
  - `Timeout` - EV not connected within timeout

- `allocationSourceName` - *String* - Name of the source currently in control of the charging session.
  - `OCPP Profile` - The OCPP profile is in control of the charging session.
  - `API` - The WebSocket or RESTful api is in control of the charging session.
