# REST / WebSocket API

The REST and WebSocket API have the same endpoints and functionality. The only difference lies in the way the limits are set. 
While it is possible to set multiple values at once through the REST API, it is only possible to set one value at a time through the WebSocket API.

Currently the API supoprts authorization with basic auth and bearer token. It can be enabled config editor and the password/token can be set there.

If you are looking for the Swagger documentation for the REST API, you can find it [**here**](/user-api/swagger).
