The transaction status topic contains information about an ongoing charging transaction.

- `id` - *String* - UUID of the charging transaction.

- `state` - *String* - State of the SECC
  - `IDLE` - No EV connected.
  - `AWAITING_START` -  An EV is connected and the EVSE is waiting for a start transaction.
  - `AWAITING_AUTHORIZATION` - An EV is connected and the EVSE is waiting for an authorization.
  - `STARTING` - An EV is connected and the EVSE is starting the charging session.
  - `SUSPENDED_EVSE` - Charging is suspended by the EVSE.
  - `SUSPENDED_EV` - The charging is suspended by the electric vehicle.
  - `CHARGING` - The EV is being charged.
  - `FAILED` - The EVSE is in an error state.
  - `STOPPED` - An EV is connected and charging is stopped.
  - `LINGERING` - An EV is currently connected or was recently connected and the EVSE is still in the same transaction.
  - `COMPLETED` - Charging is completed, EV is not connected, EVSE is available.


- `effectiveAmperageLimit` - *float* - EffectiveAmperageLimit - absolute amperage limit of the EVSE, due to cable cross section of the installation or the cable between the EVSE and the EV.

- `startedTime` - *float* - Time when the EVSE started charging.

- `endedTime` - *float* - Time when the EVSE stopped charging.

- `startReason` - *String* - Reason why the charging was started.
  - `Authorized` - Charging is authorized, by any means. Might be an RFID, or other authorization means.
  - `CablePluggedIn` - Cable is plugged in and `EVDetected`.
  - `ChargingRateChanged` - Rate of charging changed by more than `LimitChangeSignificance`.
  - `ChargingStateChanged` - Charging State changed.
  - `Deauthorized` - The transaction was stopped because of the authorization status in the response to a `transactionEventRequest`.
  - `EnergyLimitReached` - Maximum energy of charging reached. For example: in a pre-paid charging solution.
  - `EVCommunicationLost` - Communication with EV lost, for example: cable disconnected.
  - `EVConnectTimeout` - EV not connected before the connection has timed out.
  - `MeterValueClock` - Needed to send a clock aligned meter value.
  - `MeterValuePeriodic` - Needed to send a periodic meter value.
  - `TimeLimitReached` - Maximum time of charging reached. For example: in a pre-paid charging solution.
  - `Trigger` - Requested by the CSMS via a `TriggerMessageRequest`.
  - `UnlockCommand` - CSMS sent an Unlock Connector command.
  - `StopAuthorized` - An EV Driver has been authorized to stop charging. For example: By swiping an RFID card.
  - `EVDeparted` - EV departed. For example: When a departing EV triggers a parking bay detector.
  - `EVDetected` - EV detected. For example: When an arriving EV triggers a parking bay detector.
  - `RemoteStop` - A `RequestStopTransactionRequest` has been sent.
  - `RemoteStart` - A `RequestStartTransactionRequest` has been sent.
  - `AbnormalCondition` - An abnormal error or a fault condition has occurred.
  - `SignedDataReceived` - Signed data is received from the energy meter.
  - `ResetCommand` - CSMS sent a Reset Charging Station command.

- `energyActiveImportRegister` - Represents the cumulative active energy imported by the EVSE

- `lastActivePower` - *float* - Current active power of the EVSE.

- `meterStart` - *float* - Value of the energyMeter at the start of the session.

- `meterStop` - *float* - Value of the energyMeter at the end of the session.

- `peakPhaseAmperage` - *array* - Peak amperage values for each phase of the EVSE.

- `peakActivePower` - *float* - Peak active power of the EVSE.
