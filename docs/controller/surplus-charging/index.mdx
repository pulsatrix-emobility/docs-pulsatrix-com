## Solar surplus charging

Solar surplus charging is a smart energy management strategy that utilizes excess solar energy generated by rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems to charge electric vehicles (EVs). When a PV system produces more electricity than a household consumes, the surplus energy is typically exported back to the power grid or stored in a battery system. Solar surplus charging, however, diverts this surplus energy directly to an EV's battery, maximizing the self-consumption of renewable energy and minimizing reliance on the grid.

## Benefits

- Reduced electricity bills: By charging EVs with excess solar power, homeowners can significantly lower their electricity costs associated with EV ownership.

- Increased self-sufficiency: Solar surplus charging empowers homeowners to harness their own solar energy for their own needs, fostering greater energy independence.

- Environmentally friendly: Utilizing surplus solar power for EV charging further reduces the carbon footprint of both electricity consumption and EV usage.

As the adoption of solar energy and EVs continues to grow, solar surplus charging is gaining prominence as a sustainable and cost-effective solution for maximizing the benefits of renewable energy and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
